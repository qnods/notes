You can change work into any other name.\nand that's it, an environment called work should have been created.\n\n\nAfter the environment has been created and still on terminal and on your folder, type cd work with work is the name of environment you just created.\nthen type \\Scripts\\activate.bat and voila you will be entering your environment. \n\nAdditional Note&#182;To install any python package, you can just this command python -m pip install numpy with numpy is the name of the package.\nTo remove environment, just ensure you have deactivated the environment first by simply typing deactivate while you are still in environment and delete the respective folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

All of them can be used in combination with each other\n\n+ for addition\n- for substraction\n/ for division\n* for multiplication\n** for exponentiaation\n% for remainder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[4]:\n\n     \nprint (2+5)\nprint (8-2)\nprint (16/2)\nprint (9*2)\nprint (8**2)\nprint (14%3)\nprint (5+2*5)\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n7\n6\n8.0\n18\n64\n2\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable&#182;Let's talk about variable. A variable allow us to use its value by referring to the name of the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[5]:\n\n     \n#The code below is a variable and the number 777 is the value\nlucky_number = 777\n\n# We can print lucky number by just mentioning its name\nprint (lucky_number)\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n777\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Variable&#182;There are many types of variable, such as\n\nint or integer is a full number without fraction\nfloat is a number that contain fraction\nstr or string is a text. Text need to be written within single quote or double quote mark\nbool or boolean which is basically just True or False\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[6]:\n\n     \n#let&#39;s guess the type for its variable below\na = 100\nb = 0.5\nc = &quot;Good Morning&quot;\nd = True\n\n#Ready to see the answer ?\nprint (type(a))\nprint (type(b))\nprint (type(c))\nprint (type(d))\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n&lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;\n&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;\n&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;\n&lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Conversion&#182;Python allow us to convert the variable type, otherwise we cannot combine two variable into one print. This is the example:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[13]:\n\n     \n#originally this is a integer variable\ne = 888\n\n#let&#39;s try to put that into a sentence\nprint (&quot;I have &quot; + e + &quot; apples&quot;)\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-13-fdd9c2a0283b&gt; in &lt;module&gt;\n      3 \n      4 #let&#39;s try to put that into a sentence\n----&gt; 5 print (&#34;I have &#34; + e + &#34; apples&#34;)\n\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not &#34;int&#34;) to str\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;[12]:\n\n     \n# so this is how I convert the variable\nprint (&quot;I have &quot; + str(e) + &quot; apples&quot;)\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nI have 888 apples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's really plenty of apple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
