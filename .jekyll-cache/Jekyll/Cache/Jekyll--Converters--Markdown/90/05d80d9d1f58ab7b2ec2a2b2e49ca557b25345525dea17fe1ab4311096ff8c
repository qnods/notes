You can change work into any other name.and that's it, an environment called work should have been created.After the environment has been created and still on terminal and on your folder, type cd work with work is the name of environment you just created.then type \\Scripts\\activate.bat and voila you will be entering your environment. Additional Note&#182;To install any python package, you can just this command python -m pip install numpy with numpy is the name of the package.To remove environment, just ensure you have deactivated the environment first by simply typing deactivate while you are still in environment and delete the respective folder.",
