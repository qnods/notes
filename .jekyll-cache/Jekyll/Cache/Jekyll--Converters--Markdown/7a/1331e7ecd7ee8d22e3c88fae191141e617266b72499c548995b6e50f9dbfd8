However, since 2015 there is let and constlet cannot be re-declared within the same scope but it can be updatedconst cannot be re-declared and cannot be updatedData Type&#182;let age = 16;                                  // Numberlet lastName = \"Wayne\";                        // Stringlet a = {firstName:\"Clark\", lastName:\"Kent\"};  // ObjectCombining several data type in one variable, the result can be different. It is determined by the position of string data type, if it starts with string the subsequent data will be treated as string. If it is started with number, it will remain number until it reaches data with string type. Take a look at example below:In&nbsp;[1]:     %%html&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;test2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script&gt;var a = &quot;Cards &quot; + 700 + 77;var b = 700 + 77 + &quot; Cards&quot;document.getElementById(&quot;test1&quot;).innerHTML = a;document.getElementById(&quot;test2&quot;).innerHTML = b;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;             In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:           ",

You can change work into any other name.and that's it, an environment called work should have been created.After the environment has been created and still on terminal and on your folder, type cd work with work is the name of environment you just created.then type \\Scripts\\activate.bat and voila you will be entering your environment. Additional Note&#182;To install any python package, you can just this command python -m pip install numpy with numpy is the name of the package.To remove environment, just ensure you have deactivated the environment first by simply typing deactivate while you are still in environment and delete the respective folder.",
