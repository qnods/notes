        "content": "Basic Python 101                    In this note, I will record my earlier understanding about how to use PythonPutting up a comment&#182;Comment in the script will be written by putting # in front of the comment you want to write.In&nbsp;[2]:     #this will not appear in the outputprint(&quot;this one will appear in the output&quot;)             this one will appear in the outputMath Operator&#182;There are couple of math operator that can be used within python. All of them can be used in combination with each other+ for addition- for substraction/ for division* for multiplication** for exponentiaation% for remainderIn&nbsp;[4]:     print (2+5)print (8-2)print (16/2)print (9*2)print (8**2)print (14%3)print (5+2*5)             768.01864215Variable&#182;Let's talk about variable. A variable allow us to use its value by referring to the name of the variable.In&nbsp;[5]:     #The code below is a variable and the number 777 is the valuelucky_number = 777# We can print lucky number by just mentioning its nameprint (lucky_number)             777Types of Variable&#182;There are many types of variable, such asint or integer is a full number without fractionfloat is a number that contain fractionstr or string is a text. Text need to be written within single quote or double quote markbool or boolean which is basically just True or FalseIn&nbsp;[6]:     #let&#39;s guess the type for its variable belowa = 100b = 0.5c = &quot;Good Morning&quot;d = True#Ready to see the answer ?print (type(a))print (type(b))print (type(c))print (type(d))             &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;&lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt;Variable Conversion&#182;Python allow us to convert the variable type, otherwise we cannot combine two variable into one print. This is the example:In&nbsp;[13]:     #originally this is a integer variablee = 888#let&#39;s try to put that into a sentenceprint (&quot;I have &quot; + e + &quot; apples&quot;)             ---------------------------------------------------------------------------TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)&lt;ipython-input-13-fdd9c2a0283b&gt; in &lt;module&gt;      3       4 #let&#39;s try to put that into a sentence----&gt; 5 print (&#34;I have &#34; + e + &#34; apples&#34;)TypeError: can only concatenate str (not &#34;int&#34;) to strIn&nbsp;[12]:     # so this is how I convert the variableprint (&quot;I have &quot; + str(e) + &quot; apples&quot;)             I have 888 applesAnd that's really plenty of apple.",

You can change work into any other name.and that's it, an environment called work should have been created.After the environment has been created and still on terminal and on your folder, type cd work with work is the name of environment you just created.then type \\Scripts\\activate.bat and voila you will be entering your environment. Additional Note&#182;To install any python package, you can just this command python -m pip install numpy with numpy is the name of the package.To remove environment, just ensure you have deactivated the environment first by simply typing deactivate while you are still in environment and delete the respective folder.",
